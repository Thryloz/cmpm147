				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A bad weapon name generator.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>There's a base template that doesn't change. The only words that are changed are the location, weapon name, and price. The possible choices are stored in an array and randomly chosen to produce the text.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a solo assignment so there were not any group members. For my first step into html/css I learned a bit. Aside from that this assignment was mostly an initial setup and tutorial so there isnâ€™t much to reflect on. Some things I could have improved on was starting the documentation early so I can write it out as I worked on the project.</p>
