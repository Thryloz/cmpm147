			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The background and snow were created with polygons similar to the example provided. The tree trunks are multiple lines
					connected together with the thickness slowly decreasing as it goes up the screen. The branches on the side and background
					are created recursively with some randomness to their angles. The snow is creating an array of points and their size in setup(), 
					then drawing the ellipses in draw(). They're then moved down the screen and randomly left and right until they reach one
					of the edges and are moved back to the top/side.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
