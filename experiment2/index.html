				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The background and snow were created with polygons similar to the example provided. The tree trunks are multiple lines
					connected together with the thickness slowly decreasing as it goes up the screen. The branches on the side and background
					are created recursively with some randomness to their angles. The snow is creating an array of points and their size in setup(), 
					then drawing the ellipses in draw(). They're then moved down the screen and randomly left and right until they reach one
					of the edges and are moved back to the top/side.
					This project offers a generative, living impression inspired from these images:

					<a href="https://www.usu.edu/today/story/snowbound-big-trees-boost-water-in-forests-by-protecting-snowpack" target="_blank">[Source]</a><br>
					Relation to inspring image:<br>

					Color: The snow and tree colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the Krita eyedropper tool.<br>
					Primitives: The trees are rendered with line primitives.<br>
					Polygons: The two snow layers a single randomly polygon using vertex calls.<br>
					Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently positioned trees, differently shaped branches and snow.<br>
					Life: There's snow slowly falling and the whole image moves slightly with the mouse cursor.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project was pretty fun to work through. I learned a lot about how p5js handles moving stuff around and I enjoyed messing around with the branches. The biggest takeaway would be making sure everything is scalable next time so I wouldnâ€™t face the same problems. A definite high was seeing the branches for the background work really out really well. Conversely a low was finding out how everything broke when transferring to the webpage. Overall an enjoyable and useful experience.</p>
