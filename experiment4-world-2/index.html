				<p>Generate an infinite world of eyeballs that follow the cursor from the center.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Rather than using shapes and vertices, it creates two circles for the eye and eyeball. The eyeball is set to follow the mouse
					cursor, but constrained within the eye's circumference using the contrain() function, calibrated to have it centered
					around an eyeball at the center of the screen. A random function is used for the little shakiness.
					The hash function is used for the color.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> The most difficult part of creating this world was figuring out how constrain the eyeballs and how to make it so 
					the tracking isn't centered on the top left eye. There weren't many highs besides just finishing it.
